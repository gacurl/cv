## The goal

I wanted to clean up how admin styles work **without changing how anything looks or behaves**.

The admin pages were working, but each one had its own `<style>` block stuck in the file. A lot of those styles used very general names like `.container`, `.btn`, or `.status-badge`. That’s fine when everything is isolated, but it’s risky once you try to share CSS across pages.

So the goal wasn’t to redesign the UI.  
It was to make the styling **predictable and safe to change later**.

## What I covered

I went page by page and moved `<style>` blocks into a shared admin stylesheet.

I did this slowly on purpose:

- one page at a time  
- no visual changes  
- no Tailwind changes  
- tests had to stay green after every move  

Over these two days, I migrated styles for:

- sessions  
- pending coaches (with scoped rules so styles don’t leak)  
- settings (only the parts that truly belong to that page)  

Each move was small and easy to undo if something went wrong.

## What broke (and why that’s a win)

Almost immediately, I ran into a problem that explains *why* this work matters.

Different pages were using the **same class names** to mean different things. If I had copied those styles as-is, one admin page would have quietly changed how another page looked.

Instead of pushing through and fixing things later, I stopped and tightened the scope of those styles so they only apply where they’re supposed to.

That’s the real lesson here:

> CSS bugs aren’t loud. They fail quietly unless you’re careful.

Finding that early is a win.

## What I learned

- CSS is part of the system, not decoration  
- “Working” code can still be fragile  
- General class names are fine early, but dangerous later  
- Small, boring commits are safer than big cleanup passes  
- Tests give you the confidence to move things without fear

## What’s next

There are still a few admin pages with embedded styles left. I’ll keep migrating them using the same approach, saving the biggest and most custom page for last.

Once all the `<style>` blocks are gone, I’ll do a separate pass to clean up inline styles. That’s a different problem, and mixing the two would make things harder to reason about.

The goal is an admin UI that’s easier to understand, easier to change, and harder to accidentally break.
