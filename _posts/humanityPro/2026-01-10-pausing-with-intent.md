## TL;DR
I took five days away from coding to prioritize family time, then came back to do a full project review. The result was a deliberate reset of milestones and issues, with a clear intent to get HumanityPro live in under ten days.

## A deliberate pause

It’s been about five days since I last wrote code.

That wasn’t accidental. I stepped away intentionally to prioritize family time after a sustained stretch of focused work. The project was stable enough to pause, and I wanted to make sure I was making decisions from a clear head instead of momentum alone.

---

## Coming back with fresh eyes

When I returned, the first priority wasn’t writing more code — it was understanding exactly where the project stood.

That meant:
- reviewing the entire codebase end to end
- validating that milestones still reflected reality
- checking for broken links, misleading UI, and unfinished affordances
- deciding what *actually* needs to happen before going live

The outcome was clear: the system is solid, but the path to launch needed tightening.

## Resetting milestones with intent

Instead of pushing forward blindly, I overhauled the GitHub milestone structure.

Milestones were clarified, narrowed, and reordered so they answer one question each:
- **Milestone 5** now cleanly finishes admin observability work
- **Milestone 6** is definition-only, protecting future AI work from rushing
- **Milestone 8** was added explicitly to cover production launch

Each milestone now has a small, intentional set of issues with clear exit criteria. No mixed concerns. No aspirational scope.

---

## A clear launch target

The goal is now explicit: **get HumanityPro live in less than ten days**.

That doesn’t mean cramming in features. It means:
- no broken or placeholder links
- no misleading UI
- a production environment that boots cleanly
- core flows that work and are observable

Anything that doesn’t support that goal is intentionally deferred.

---

## Back to execution

With the milestone list reset and the issue backlog cleaned up, it’s time to return to implementation.

The next work is straightforward and bounded: closing the remaining admin cleanup issues, then shifting fully into launch readiness.

Pausing didn’t slow the project down. It made the path forward clearer.

Onward.
