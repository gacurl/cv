## The goal

I wanted lightweight regression (“canary”) tests for core admin flows so changes don’t silently break the app.

These tests are intentionally shallow:

- sign in as admin
- hit the route
- assert the response

That’s it.

## What I covered

I added smoke tests for:

- admin dashboard root
- users
- coaches
- pending coaches
- coach details

---

## What broke (and why that’s a win)

While adding the coach details canary, the admin dashboard exposed real-world breakpoints:

- missing or renamed associations caused query failures
- optional features (like profile photos via Active Storage) could break rendering in some environments

Instead of letting admin pages crash, I added safe fallbacks so the dashboard still renders even when optional dependencies or associations aren’t available.

## What’s next

Next up is a non-admin access denial canary, then deployment behind a subdomain so I can start sharing real progress regularly.
