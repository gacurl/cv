TL;DR: Milestone 1 is complete, Proof-of-Fun is locked, and the project is ready for real puzzle logic.

**Project page:** [/projects/plumafill/](/projects/plumafill/)

## Context
Milestone 1 focused on interaction, not correctness. The goal was to validate that the puzzle felt playable and understandable before introducing data models or validation rules.

Yesterday closed that loop.

## What changed
- Added a Clear / Reset action to fully wipe the grid and feedback state
- Confirmed keyboard navigation and input constraints behave consistently
- Closed Milestone 1 after Proof-of-Fun criteria were met
- Normalized blog structure and publishing flow for ongoing development notes

## What I learned
- Reset behavior is a first-class interaction, not a convenience
- Finishing a milestone cleanly makes the next one easier to reason about
- Writing while context is fresh prevents narrative drift later

## Next
- Start Milestone 2
- Introduce a real puzzle data model
- Shift focus from interaction to correctness
