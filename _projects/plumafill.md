PlumaFill is a native iOS fill-in word puzzle app — think crossword vibes, minus the clues — focused on clean UX, offline play, and not over-engineering the fun out of it.

## Why it exists

I’m building PlumaFill to practice shipping a small product end-to-end: design, implementation, iteration, and release.  
The goal is clarity over cleverness, momentum over perfection, and learning by actually finishing something.

(Also, I like word puzzles.)

## Progress

- ✅ **Milestone 0:** Xcode project boots cleanly in the simulator (“Hello, world!”) with a locked baseline commit
- ⏳ **Milestone 1:** App skeleton (navigation + empty puzzle screen)
- ⏭️ **Next:** Puzzle data model + first playable grid

## What this project demonstrates

- Milestone-driven product planning
- Core game logic (grid, slots, validation)
- Native iOS development with SwiftUI
- Shipping discipline: MVP first, polish later

## Screenshots

> Coming soon — once the app does something more exciting than politely existing.
