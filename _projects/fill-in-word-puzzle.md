</span>

A native iOS fill-in word puzzle app (crossword-style without clues) focused on clean UX, offline play, and disciplined MVP delivery.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- Milestone-driven product planning
- Core game logic (grid, slots, validation)
- Native iOS development with SwiftUI
- Shipping discipline: MVP first, iterate later
